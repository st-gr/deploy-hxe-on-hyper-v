# Chapter One: Motivation
SAP provides a trial version of their in-memory HANA database named HANA Express as an *Open Virtual Appliance (.ova) container*.

Several virtualization software platforms support the Open Virtual Appliance (OVA) format. Prominent examples include VMware Workstation, VirtualBox, and other VMware products like Workstation Player, and vSphere. Additionally, platforms like Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization, Oracle VM, and some cloud services also support OVA.

This list unfortunately does not include Microsoft Hyper-V that is included with the Professional or Enterprise editions of Windows.

This guide will walk you through how to deploy SAP HANA Express or with some modifications ***basically any Linux appliance in the .ova format to Microsoft Hyper-V.***
